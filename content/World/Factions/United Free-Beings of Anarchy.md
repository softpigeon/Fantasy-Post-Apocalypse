A semi coordinated collection of bandit and raider groups that operate under the same banner, they are following old world advice that "branding" is important. One of their main tactics is to bring other bands into the fold, the new band gets supplies from them in return for a share of their loot (MLM bandits). Although usually the under band often gets fed up and destroys their overlord or gets wiped out in the process.
