Spending time in an area of radioactive activity without protection incurs the risk of radiation poisoning, the amount of time required inside the area depends on the level of radiation with low level radiation starting at a few minutes. Resisting the effects of radiation and suffering from radiation poisoning require a Constitution (Stamina) Basic Test with a starting TN dependant on the level of radiation, increasing with each period of 1 hour in the radiation. (radiation has been generalised so as not too have to worry about the different and specific types of radiation, it has also been made far less instantly lethal at higher doses)

low level radiation (fully protected against by stable iodine pills) will start at TN 13 with each level incrementing the TN according to TN table (15 - 17 etc.), each hour within a level increases the TN to the next stage (staying in one level for 1 hour or more effectively counts as a new exposure of a level higher)

### Effects

Figure out the specific effects of radiation poisoning in case it becomes relevant.
Severity increases over time and continued failed Constitution (Stamina) rolls.

Each Stage last for a day after which a TN 17 Constitution (Stamina) Basic Check is required a failure increases the stage by 1 (2 if the stunt die is a 1) a success decreases the stage by (2 if the stunt die is a 6). 

Proper treatment can either cure or reduce the stage for Stage 1 and 2. For Stages 3 and up the Treatment can halt further progress as indicated. Regardless of the stage treatment gives a +3 bonus to the roll. Treatment from an untrained healer can provided a +2 bonus but wont immediately lower or cure Stage 1 and 2, It will prevent progress to later stages for these stages and other indicated stages.

| Stage | Effects                        | Treatment                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | effects of 1st degree Fatigued | can be cured, <br>SI pills can halt progress to later stages |
| 2     | effects of 2nd degree Fatigued | can be reduced                                               |
| 3     | effects of 3rd degree Fatigued | can halt progress to later stages                            |
| 4     | as stage 3 plus Defenceless    | can halt progress to later stages                            |
| 5     | as stage 4 plus Confusion      | cannot halt progress to later stages                         |
| 6     | as stage 5 plus Unconscious    | cannot halt progress to later stages                         |
| 7     | Death                          |                                                              |

### Attacks

Radiation based attacks will simply be handled like any other attack, however wearing a suit or having consumed stable iodine will provide some resistance (small resistance from pills big resistance from suit provided it's not damaged). The will not automatically give radiation poisoning unless the specific attack has the risk of contracting it. i.e. every attack will be on a case by case basis.
