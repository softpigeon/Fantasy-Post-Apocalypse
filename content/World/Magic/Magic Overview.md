First appeared in a near cataclysmic event that shattered and remade the entire world. All races have an innate affinity and aptitude to this magic that now permeates the world with the exception of Humans. Humans are the descendants of those who remained protected from the magic storm by their metal towns and thus have no in-built connection, although through various means can utilise magic (e.g. intense study, meditation, a connection formed individually or inherited from ancestors etc.).

The form magic takes depends on the individual, while there doesn’t appear to be a biological predisposition for a particular expression of magic, one’s culture and mental patterns tends to breed a particular aptitude for a certain expression

Iron and Lead are magics main weakness as Iron is highly resistant to magical influence and Lead completely ignores and blocks magic’s influence. Pure iron exhibits nearly the same ability as Lead however it is most often present with some other mineral (e.g. carbon) and thus loses some effectiveness. Alloys containing Iron are also resistant to magic however the level of resistance is dependent on the percentage iron content. As Lead is toxic to living beings it is often not used widely, its safe production and handling/use is one the secrets guarded by the Human communities although other peoples still use it to varying levels of safety.

If using Fantasy Age how does the magic system of the world lead to the arcana used in Fantasy Age? (i.e. magic system should allow for the system’s mechanics to make sense, essentially the mechanics of Fantasy Age will do some of the heavy lifting)
