Currently thinking of using a Taiga region, possibly Somewhere in Canada or Alaska.

A fledgling Kingdom that has been established in the last 50 years and incorporated the surrounding area.

Most settlements started out of the ruins of old settlements, but were replaced with newer buildings of more contemporary design, due to not wanting to live in dilapidated buildings and lacking the knowledge and technology to rebuild with more advanced materials. Some smaller settlements in remote regions still have a few old world buildings but these are mostly for storage etc. with dwellings being built in more maintainable styles. Requiring more solidly constructed buildings to keep the interior warm also just aesthetics man.
