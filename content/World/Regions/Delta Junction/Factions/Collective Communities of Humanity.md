The term for the remaining [[Human]] populations that remaining living in the towns built around the nuclear shelters that protected them from both the nuclear and magical apocalypses. 

Humans from these towns are referred to as "Community Humans" to differentiate them from the Humans who have left to live in the world at large. The majority of humans continue to live in these communities, those who wish to leave are stripped of their memories and any advanced technology. The only Community Humans that are found in the world at large are agents actively working on their behalf; usually collected lost knowledge and technology to safeguard, or running a few outposts focused on collecting resources that can't be gathered at home.

Minimal trading happens with the outside world but it does happen.
