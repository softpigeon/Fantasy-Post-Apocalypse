New arrivals

Appeared after magic arrived, initially antagonistic towards most due to language barriers. Once communication could be established they integrated into they societies (such as they are) that exist. Some did retreat to form isolationist goblin only societies that remain antagonistic with others.

Record keeping was not a major part of Goblin society (if it was at all) and having a lifespan comparable to a Human any who would know where they came from has passed long since passed away so the origins of this species on Earth are a mystery to themselves.
