It is possible for any pairing to create a hybrid offspring, Magic can alter the necessary biology to make sperm and egg compatible however this is rare and many pairings would need hundreds of attempts before the time this happens. However Humans and races that are altered humans (Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Orcs) are able to create hybrid offspring far more easily with each other with Magic not needing to interfere however it is still less effective than a non hybrid pairing.
