Descendants of changed humans. Same height on average as humans although there are more on the extreme ends of the scale than there would be for humans. By far the most populous of the races of the world they can be found in every part of the known world. The Elves don’t have a unique cultural identity of their own per se as the vast majority of the current civilizations were founded by elves, therefore the cultural identity for an Elf is the culture of the civilization they were raised in. Reaching Maturity around 16-20 and with lifespans lasting upwards several centuries, “young” elves rarely find any urgent need or pressure to settle down so often spend the first century or so trying their hand at many different occupations or vocations before doing so. Physically they resemble humans often with more sharply defined angular features, and pointed ears of varying lengths from roughly human sized to comically large. Becoming an Elf was by far the most common end result of the transformation for those that survived.
