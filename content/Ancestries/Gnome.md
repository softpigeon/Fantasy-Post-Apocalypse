While looking humanoid they are not descendants of changed humans, A playful and somewhat mischievous people they just appeared not long after the magic cataclysm, having magically arrived from another world. Whether this other world is an alternate/parallel reality/dimension or simply another planet far away is unknown. When asked, Gnomes refer to this world in different ways, often using names they’ve learned from old human myths, e.g. Faerie, the Feywild, Alfheim etc.. In truth the name of their world is simply World in their language. There are few permanent settlements of gnomes as most take towards a nomadic lifestyle wandering the world in search of new inspiration or avenues for whatever passion currently holds their attention. Many gnomes are not content to sit on their laurels and accept “known” limitations for what they are and had made several non-magical technical advancements and started to augment their knowledge of magic with mundane sciences taking a more scientific view of the field, they brought with them a knowledge of black powder weapons and machinery to help and uplift fledgling new settlements/civilisations they encountered that accept their help. These gnomes who started to poke around the ruins of the ancient human civilisation soon discovered hints of a trove of knowledge that far outweighed their own, some started to form groups to seek out this “lost” knowledge and often run into scuffles with Community Human agents who view this knowledge as dangerous for the new world and seek to safeguard this information, knowing the damage this technology is capable of.
