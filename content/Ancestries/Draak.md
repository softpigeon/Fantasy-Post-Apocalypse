The most recent new arrivals

Draconic Humanoids, came down from mountains and emerged from dense woodlands and swamps across the world in the last few years and have spread all over, a rather rare sight but known to most people. 

Draak are reticent to speak of where they came from originally but those who have speak of a world much like Earth albeit with many large mountain ranges that span much of the landmass and chaotic and violent weather patterns.
