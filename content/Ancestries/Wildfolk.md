This ancestry arrived from the same world that gnomes did. Wildfolk have a love of nature that often put them at odds with the Gnomes back home due to their ever pursuit of scientific and technological progress regardless of the environmental or societal consequences. Many came over to try and stem the impact the Gnomes might have on this new world but quickly saw the original inhabits had already accomplished their fears.
Some see the ruins and wreckage of Earth as well as the records of environmental damage from industrialisation as a warning to the dangers of this blind devotion to "progress" and wish to impart this lesson to others.
