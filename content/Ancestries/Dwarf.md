**==Review, I always seem to make dwarves rare or extinct
Potentially formed from communities suffering from anaemia causing blood disorders==**

Descendants of changed humans. On average shorter than most humans although some grow to the same height as an average height human. Their main differing feature is their broad and stocky frame with a somewhat proportionally longer torso. The majority of humans who became dwarves during the cataclysm all happened to be close to each other and thus they formed a community which has now become the dwarf nation (needs a name). Most Dwarves live in this nation and the nation is home to other races as well, some dwarves live in the wilder world however they are a novel or rare sight. The cultural identities of dwarves tend to be the same as the Dwarf Nation, although the rare few born and raised elsewhere may have split culture between their home nation and the Dwarf Nation. Becoming a Dwarf was the rarest end result of the transformation for those that survived.

I'm also thinking maybe the transformation gave them a reliance on magic as their new bodies now make up for low iron count by utilising magic to fill the role, and this connection makes it very easy for dwarves to become mages but the groups choose to focus on improving their abilities in things that don't come as second nature (mining, blacksmithing etc.) but can use this easy magic connection to supplement their work
