**==Review, I always seem to make dwarves rare or extinct==**

Descendants of changed humans. On average shorter than most humans although some grow to the same height as an average height human. Their main differing feature is their broad and stocky frame with a somewhat proportionally longer torso. The majority of humans who became dwarves during the cataclysm all happened to be close to each other and thus they formed a community which has now become the dwarf nation (needs a name). Most Dwarves live in this nation and the nation is home to other races as well, some dwarves live in the wilder world however they are a novel or rare sight. The cultural identities of dwarves tend to be the same as the Dwarf Nation, although the rare few born and raised elsewhere may have split culture between their home nation and the Dwarf Nation. Becoming a Dwarf was the rarest end result of the transformation for those that survived.
