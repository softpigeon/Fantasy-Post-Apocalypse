Earth a few centuries after an apocalyptic nuclear war wiped out the majority of the [[Human]] population.

Humans mostly formed small isolated communities constructed out of the remains of large emergency military compounds and bunkers to survive, some remained out in the world at large.

Three hundred years later as the human communities had started flourishing again, with huge numbers now living outside the communities, Magic suddenly manifested in the world, no one is yet sure what caused magic to appear, however it was a sudden and violent occurrence with seven shockwaves circling the planet nine times each.

Humans who were outside of the communities that were constructed from reclaimed iron/steel (those with a metal wall ringing their community, even if only ringing parts not bordering a hill/mountainside) found themselves changed into several new forms: [[Elf|Elves]], [[Halfling|Halflings]], [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], and [[Orc|Orcs]]. Most did not survive the transformation (Those with a lower blood iron count being most likely to survive) Those who survived had their memories of their being beforehand wiped not remembering who they were or that they were ever human.

Many other fantasy ancestries appeared following this event, the exact origin of many of these other species (especially the non sentient or aggressive) are a mystery. Notable examples of these are: [[Draak]], [[Gnome|Gnomes]], [[Goblin|Goblins]], and [[Wildfolk]] 

Some of these ancestries have since intermingled to create some [[Hybrid]] ancestries, Half Humans being the least common due to the majority living in isolationist communities
